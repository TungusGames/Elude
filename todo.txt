Enemies - rocket types
- Satellite (orbit around player) - LowGrav?
- Factory
	- Normal: weak enemies with TurningRocket
	- Med: stronger, LowGrav
	- Hard: slow firing HighGrav, tanklike
- Shielded (only hittable from one direction) - LowGrav?
- Tank (slow shooter, lots of hp) - HighGrav?/BIG LASER?
- Recolored standing and moving enemies with LowGrav and HighGrav?
- MachineGun - lots of rockets, then nothing

Bosses?
- Some of the above (maybe combined) can be considered bosses...

    - Standing, laser shooting + producing enemies?
    - What else?
