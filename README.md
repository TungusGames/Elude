# Elude
Elude is a game where you defeat armies of enemies shooting at you without any weapons - you just need to get them to hit each other with their own rockets!
It's available on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tungus.games.elude

## Features
The game has 50 campaign levels, 15 infinite wave modes and over 10 enemy types including two bosses. A working multiplayer is implemented, but is not actually presented in the game as we didn't figure out what kind of multiplayer modes would make sense.

## Technology
We used the libGDX game development framework to easily prototype on desktop and then build for Android. 

## Creators
Game created by Péter Mernyei, Tamás Tardos and Benedek Stadler as a hobby project.
