03: two HPickups on an easy level with recently increased healing...
"HP left" medal requirement increased from 65 to 80
Also, Movings can be tricky to hit at first. Time medal from 35 to 45 sec
04 OK (Maybe could be named "Supernova"?)

09 HP medal way too low. Increased from 70 to 85 (At least the medals should get somewhat close to challanging by here I suppose?)
10: Way too short. Added more standing enemies as a first wave, 2x12 enemies now
New name (again): "Long arrivals"
11: Lengthened to make sense with prev level. Took me 1:16, but why not I guess.
12: I don't get the title... ("This is boring"). Reference to prev 2 levels maybe? Not really obvious. Renamed "Quick strike"
Also, both medals a bit harder (30 -> 27 sec, 80 -> 85 hp). Ought to be increasing IMO.
13: Fine I suppose :)
14: There should be more enemies arriving after miners to shoot them. Added and increased time medal accordingly.
15: Time medal made easier, one HPickup removed
16 OK
17: Time nowhere near enough. Set from 30 to 55 sec
18: Time down from 40 to 20 sec.

Swapped 15 with 18 because 18 teaches killing with mines. New 15 = prev 18 titled "You go kamikaze" like prev 15, new 18 = prev 15 titled "Minefield battle"

19: If there's a shield, there might as well be a ridiculous amount of kamikazes. :)
20: Enemies have no firepower, user has shield - might as well make HP medal hard (from 60 to 92 hp)
21: Left a lot of shields lying because more appeared at the same time, so lowered shield drop rate. Also HP rate. Also, harder medals again.. (35-> 30sec, 75->85 hp)
22: Reduced pickups, adjusted medals
23: Adjusted medals
24: Reduced huge amount of pickups, adjusted medals
25: Set medals
(HP medals turned out way lower than other levels around. Does that mean the level is too hard??)

From here on, not mentioning "adjusted medals/pickups"...

26: Removed first wave. Tedious.
27: OK (just medals)
28 and 29: Loads of enemies onscreen at once --> reduced pickup rates
29: Shortened a lot. Still over a minute anyway.
30: OK
31: OK
32: OK
33: Hardened
34: OK
35: OK
36: OK
37: Significantly rewritten, was very easy
38, 39: OK
40: Hard, moved after next 2 levels
41: Pushed to 40. Modified to be better as an introductory level
42: Pushed to 41, mostly oK
43: Way too easy, changed Movings to Splitter/MachineGunner
44: OK
45: Waaay too many enemies past where it's pointful, reduced most of the numbers without changing the enemy names / etc => Great level! :D
