03: two HPickups on an easy level with recently increased healing...
"HP left" medal requirement increased from 65 to 80
Also, Movings can be tricky to hit at first. Time medal from 35 to 45 sec
04 OK (Maybe could be named "Supernova"?)

09 HP medal way too low. Increased from 70 to 85 (At least the medals should get somewhat close to challanging by here I suppose?)
10: Way too short. Added more standing enemies as a first wave, 2x12 enemies now
New name (again): "Long arrivals"
11: Lengthened to make sense with prev level. Took me 1:16, but why not I guess.
12: I don't get the title... ("This is boring"). Reference to prev 2 levels maybe? Not really obvious. Renamed "Quick strike"
Also, both medals a bit harder (30 -> 27 sec, 80 -> 85 hp). Ought to be increasing IMO.
13: Fine I suppose :)
14: There should be more enemies arriving after miners to shoot them. Added and increased time medal accordingly.
15: Time medal made easier, one HPickup removed
